Please consider a few things while working on it:

(1) Maximal accuracy will help make the best out of the translation.

(2) Be creative (only) upon meeting the requirement of picking the most identical match.

(3) It makes sense to be similarly concise as the original.

(4) Please let’s always use the same translations on identical source expressions.

(If "trashed notes" is "gelöschte Dateien" in German, you would always translate it in this way. Exception would be when you grammatically need or should better use an alternative - make sure you’re not adding more versions than necessary (maximally two or three).

Please make sure “note” is always identically translated (just one equivalent, please!)

(5) For plural please add the appropriate translation in the corresponding fields and make sure to add an alternative translation where it is required.
